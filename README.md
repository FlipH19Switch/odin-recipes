This project was an exercise in creating a basic website using only HTML. It 
allowed me to demonstrate my skills in writing HTML, creating and managing 
files in the command line, and using Git and GitHub. After completing the 
project, I feel more comfortable creating and linking basic webpages to each 
other and pushing my work to GitHub.
