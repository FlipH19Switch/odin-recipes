    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe takes 45 minutes to complete and will provide six pecan bars. You will need nine total ingredients. The bars can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days once finished.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>5 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp granulated Swerve sweetener</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp brown Swerve sweetener</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Use parchment paper to line a 1-quart (~7 in x 5 in) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine the almond flour, melted butter, granulated Swerve sweetener, vanilla extract, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the contents of the bowl into the lined baking dish. This will be the crust.</li>
        <li>Put the bowl in the oven for 12-15 minutes. You can remove the bowl once the ingredients are set. Keep the oven at 350 F after removing the bowl.</li>
        <li>Let the crust cool while you prepare the topping.</li>
        <li>Place a small saucepan on the stove with the heat set to medium.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and brown Swerve sweetener to the saucepan.</li>
        <li>While whisking the butter and sweetener together, bring them to a boil and remove the saucepan from the heat after one minute of boiling.</li>
        <li>Beat one egg in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly add 1-2 tbsp of the butter-sweetener mixture to the egg. This will gradually heat the egg without cooking it.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the egg mixture to the rest of the butter-sweetener mixture while whisking it.</li>
        <li>Stir the chopped pecans into the egg-butter-sweetener mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour this mixture onto the crust to form the pie.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie at 350 F for 15-20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven once the topping has browned and set.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool on a rack for at least 15 minutes before cutting into six pieces and enjoying.</li>
    </ol>
